====================

My first ever RPG project in HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery

#Synopsis
This is a simple RPG project that uses the power of HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery as its core languages.
This will also my main testing field to try out new ideas and also create my own flavor of a Javascript RPG Engine.

#Motivation
My main motivation is to learn how to create a game. Understand the basics of creating an engine environment.
Why RPG? I guess my simple answer would be is that I love RPG. And I also love stories in games. Games for me are like novels. And when I was a kid, I wanted to do games.

I guess it is high time to start doing something I love.
